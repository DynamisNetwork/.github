## What is Dynamis?

Dynamis is an Agentic Operating System for deploying, coordinating, and verifying autonomous AI agents at scale. It replaces heuristic trust models with mathematically proven consensus based on **Sheaf Neural Networks** and **H0 Cohomology** from algebraic topology.

The core innovation is the **Sheaf Gatekeeper**: a topological verification layer that detects semantic inconsistencies among distributed AI agents in real time. When agents disagree, the system calculates a *Holonomy Defect* on the Sheaf Laplacian. If the mathematics does not close, the network knows something is wrong before any damage occurs.

### Core Technology

- **Sheaf Neural Networks** for topological consensus via H0 Cohomology
- **Holoflux Oracle** for cryptographically verified AI inference
- **Trust Economics** replacing gas fees with capacity bonding
- **Post-Quantum Security** via NIST Dilithium-3 (FIPS 204)
- **AVX-512 Acceleration** through Java 25 Panama FFM
- **Formal Verification** with 30+ TLA+ specifications
